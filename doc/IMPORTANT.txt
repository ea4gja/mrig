IMPORTANT NOTICE
----------------

Do _NOT_ allow the entire planet to use your rig! You do not want to
violate the terms of your amateur radio licence... do you?

Please set up a VPN between both the radio site and the control site, and
do not allow rigserve to listen on a publicly reachable IP address and port.

Do _not_ allow any of the rigserve services to be reachable from the Internet
either...

If you do, YOUR RADIO WILL BE USED BY EVERYONE BUT YOU.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
