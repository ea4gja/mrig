The steps are:

1) Be sure you have the python interpreter installed; the python
   used during the development of the system has been python version 2.7.6

2) Install the required dependency packages (currently just Tkinter should be
   needed)

3) Copy mrig/ to its installation directory (for instance, under /home/my_user)

4) Edit the config file (in this example, /home/my_user/mrig/mrig_config.py).
   Please do not remove the comments, they will help you the next time you
   need to edit the same file

5) Be sure the rig is turned on

6) Be sure mrigd is installed and running

7) Run mrig.py to connect to mrig
