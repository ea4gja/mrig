The steps are:

1) Be sure you have the python interpreter installed; the python
   used during the development of the system has been python version 2.7.6

2) Install the required dependency packages (currently just Pyserial should be
   needed)

3) Copy mrigd/ to its installation directory (for instance, under /home/my_user)

4) Edit the config file (in this example, /home/my_user/mrigd/mrigd_config.py).
   Please do not remove the comments, they will help you the next time you
   need to edit the same file

5) Be sure the rig is turned on

6) Be sure that the network configuration does _NOT_ allow external
   connections directly from the Internet. Do use a VPN instead!

7) Run mrigd.py to have the rig available from the network

8) Take some time to check that the services are _NOT_ available from the
   Internet! Check that you need to use the VPN to connect to the system!
   You do not want the whole Earth to be allowed to push your PTT, do you?
