CHANGE LOG

** Version 0.31: 04/29/08
Ten-Tec Omni VI / Omni VI Plus and IC-765 support
Add Capabilities mechanism to allow backends to select supported
methods within a Rig family (e.g., Icom)
Improve "NAK" error checking after I/O operations.

** Version 0.30 (various files): 8/28/07

Revised Icom class with R8500 and R75 subclasses, with assistance from Jim
Watson, M0DNS.  A large CI-V table is incorporated based on the listing from
Ekkehard Plicht, DF4OR. This should make it easier to extend coverage to 
other Icom models.

Minor changes in other files.

** Version 0.22: 5/7/07

Added cgi-bin example of access to rigserve via webserver & cgi script.
Other minor changes.

** Version 0.21: 2/15/07

Minor changes.  Exported to SVN  (cf http://sourceforge.net/projects/rigserve)

** Version 0.2:  2/1/2007

Changed Backend.py to provide skeletal methods only, which always return
"None".  If a method returns "None", that means that the current rig
definition subclass has not overlayed this method.  I.e., the method is
unimplemented for the current rig.  (Used in "test" function.) Simplifies the
"status" function.

Rewrote Backends and Rigserve.py to specify "put", "get", and "test" in the
body of a single method for each function, like af_gain.  No major change to
user interface.

Change 'atten' command to work from a list of pre-specified settings for each
rig, rather than specifying an actual number of dB in the hope that the
backend can actually achieve it.

Provided local "_v" variables to hold settings for most commands.  These are
rarely used for now, but they provide a "cheap" way to get a setting without
going out to the rig each time.

Cleaned up the code.

Tested simultaneous operation of IC-R8500 and Orion.

** Version 0.1: 11/15/2006 Preliminary release.
