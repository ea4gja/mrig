RIGSERVE
Experimental socket-driven rig interface

(c) 2006-2008 Martin Ewing AA6E


Rigserve provides access to amateur radio transceivers, communications
receivers and similar devices through text commands sent over a socket
interface.  Client software may be written in any convenient language
using any operating system.  Clients may access the server locally or 
from anywhere on the Internet.

This program is developed under Python v 2.4.3 running under Fedora 8
Linux (kernel 2.6.24). Besides standard Python libraries, it
requires the pyserial package, available from pyserial.sourceforge.net.

Rigserve is made available under the GNU General Public License.  Comments
and bug reports are welcome.

This project is based loosely on the Hamlib project (www.hamlib.org)
to which I am greatly indebted.

More details are provided in readme-be.txt, readme-developer.txt, and in
user_guide.odt or user_guide.html.  'user_guide.odt'is Open Document Text
file that was prepared with OpenOffice.org.
